              <p>This is my portfolio website, only made for the days when Flash dominated the Internet. The modern site you currently see was developed with the same key goal as its Flash predecessor: to display the portfolio pieces of its creator. In the old design concept, each portfolio piece is represented by an amoeba floating in the browser window. Generation and behavior of the amoebas was programmed to mimic real-world physics for a naturalistic and hypnotic effect.</p>
              <p>With the rise of mobile devices, screens for viewing the web have become increasingly smaller and require increasing flexibility of execution for optimum display across the various mobile platforms. Additionally, with Appleâ€™s elimination of the Adobe Flash plugin, this animation-rich website has become obsolete and needed updating with something more flexible.</p>
              <p>For those that wish to experience this piece of personal history, make sure your browser is Flash enabled and click the link below.</p>
