              <p>The IDML Parser is something I developed while working at <a href="http://www.uncommonsense.com/">Salva O&apos;Renick</a>, it was first created to circumvent the lengthy process of a designer having to customize a plethera of Adobe Indesign documents with orders from every branch of a national resturant chain. During a research phase the team I was working with discovered many applications that allowed this sort of customization, but without any impressive real-time visual feedback during the customization process. The application further made it&apos;s significance by using IDML (Indesign&apos;s new standard XML format) to almost completely recreate the Indesign document inside of flash. Also by communicating with Adobe during the Beta development of their Text Layout Framework for Flash I was able to insure that fonts could be produced almost indentically to they way they were laid out in Indesign.</p>
              <p>Above is the application that is displaying a test Indesign document that I created for demonstration.</p>
