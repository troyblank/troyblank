                 <p>The IDML Parser is something I developed while working at <a href="http://www.uncommonsense.com/" target="_blank">Salva O'Renick</a>, it was first created to circumvent the lengthy process of a designer having to customize a plethera of Adobe Indesign documents with orders from every branch of a national resturant chain. During a research phase the team I was working with discovered many applications that allowed this sort of customization, but without any impressive real-time visual feedback during the customization process. The application further made it's significance by using IDML (Indesign's new standard XML format) to almost completely recreate the Indesign document inside of flash. Also by communicating with Adobe during the Beta development of their Text Layout Framework for Flash I was able to insure that fonts could be produced almost indentically to they way they were laid out in Indesign.</p>
                <p>Above is the application that is displaying a test Indesign document that I created for demonstration.</p>
