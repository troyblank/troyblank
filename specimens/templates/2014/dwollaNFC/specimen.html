                <p>Dwolla is a payment network that allows you to move money for just $0.25 a transaction making it a very attractive method of taking payments. After personally using Dwolla to purchase goods in the real world I have found it can be a little bit of an awkward experience. Currently there is no great way for a merchant to allow a Dwolla transaction and get a confirmation without having to looking up the transaction by comparing the price, transaction id, or knowing the buyers user name on Dwolla. All these scenarios takes a little conversation, something most people are not used to doing when purchasing goods on the go. This might not be too hard for a small shop to accommodate, but what if a merchant has a lot transitions happening at once, or verbal communication is not achievable in a given environment?</p>
                <p>To solve this problem I proposed a rough demo that uses NFC to allow a transaction that happens without the people involved having to ask each other any questions; stream-ling the purchase process and allowing Dwolla to save everyone money. All is needed is two devices that can use NFC and are connected to the Internet. The merchant enters the price of the purchase on one end and all the buyer has to do is tap their device on the merchants device, enter their pin and both devices will get a confirmation as soon as the transaction goes through. Not only is this a less awkward buying experience it allows a merchant to be more anonymous allowing for cool concepts like arcades or vending machines that take Dwolla instead of credit cards or cash.</p>
                <p>The demo I created is and Android app that allows a merchant and a client mode, this allows two people running android to facilitate an NFC transaction. This means a buyer could have an Android tablet or phone and use this app to take NFC payments. It is worthwhile to note that this demo could easily be extended to any device allowing NFC communication, this could be a computer with an NFC adapter attached to USB, or a custom made kiosk device. The video above shows a simple transaction between two people with Android phones.</p>
                <p>Below you can find the code for the Cordova project as well as two unsigned debug apps for testing; one that uses Dwolla and one that uses Dwolla's sandbox (<a href="https://uat.dwolla.com" target="_blank">uat.dwolla.com</a>). Please note you will need to be sure you Android device is configured to run an application outside of Android Play to install these apps.</p>
