                 <p>This is a video I produced for the AIDS Walk Kansas City kick-off celebration and general promotion. This year's AIDS Walk theme was "Walk Forward, Count Backward." To capture this spirit, the whole video was shot in reverse. The video is constructed around a loose narrative of using the act of walking as a metaphor for how the annual AIDS Walk helps people in the community can lead better lives with HIV. The suffering caused by HIV, represented by the actors' battered physical appearance, is reversed through the course of the video, representing the advances in medical research and community involvement supported by AIDS Walk. With this project, I performed all of the camera work, editing, and special effects. If you are in the KC area and want to help the cause, please check out <a href="http://www.aidswalkkansascity.org/" target="_blank">AIDS Walk Kansas City</a>. Also a special thanks goes out to <a href="http://www.minus-story.com/" target="_blank">Minus Story</a> for letting me use their song.</p>
